# crypto-sandbox

**2021-01-14:** I created this repository, because I started really getting
into cryptography. This sandbox is where I plan to experiment with what I
learn. Currently, most of it is pretty elementary. But I thought maybe some
who are also getting into cryptography might find it interesting or useful.
Feel free to use any of the code and let me know what you think and give me
any tips and tricks you might have! Thanks!
